                                The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the
                                coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global
                                pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
                                caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
                                coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first
                                identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The
                                World Health Organization declared a Public
                                Health Emergency of International Concern
                                regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later
                                declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 7
                                June 2021, more than 173 million cases have been
                                confirmed, with more than 3.73 million confirmed
                                deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of
                                the deadliest pandemics in history.

                                Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from
                                mild symptoms to severe illness. Common symptoms
                                include headache, loss of smell and taste, nasal
                                congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain,
                                sore throat, fever, diarrhea, and breathing
                                difficulties. People with the same infection may
                                have different symptoms, and their symptoms may
                                change over time. Three common clusters of
                                symptoms have been identified: one respiratory
                                symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of
                                breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom
                                cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache,
                                and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms
                                with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. In
                                people without prior ear, nose, and throat
                                disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of
                                smell is associated with COVID-19. Of people who
                                show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate
                                symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14%
                                develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or
                                more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) and
                                5% of patients suffer critical symptoms
                                (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan
                                dysfunction). At least a third of the people who
                                are infected with the virus do not develop
                                noticeable symptoms at any point in time. These
                                asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and
                                can spread the disease. Other infected people
                                will develop symptoms later, called
                                "pre-symptomatic", or have very mild symptoms
                                and can also spread the virus. As is common with
                                infections, there is a delay between the moment
                                a person first becomes infected and the
                                appearance of the first symptoms. The median
                                delay for COVID-19 is four to five days. Most
                                symptomatic people experience symptoms within
                                two to seven days after exposure, and almost all
                                will experience at least one symptom within 12
                                days.] Most people recover from the acute phase
                                of the disease. However, some people continue to
                                experience a range of effects for months after
                                recovery—named long COVID—and damage to organs
                                has been observed. Multi-year studies are
                                underway to further investigate the long-term
                                effects of the disease

                                The virus is transmitted mainly via the
                                respiratory route, when people inhale droplets
                                and particles that infected people release as
                                they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze or sing. The
                                closer people interact, and the longer they
                                interact, the more likely they are to transmit
                                COVID-19, but infection can occur over longer
                                distances, particularly indoors. People are at
                                their peak of infectiousness when their symptoms
                                start, and are infectious for up to 3 days prior
                                to this. Their infectiousness declines after the
                                first week, but they remain contagious for up to
                                20 days, and can spread the virus even if they
                                never developed any symptoms. The size of the
                                infectious particles is on a continuum, ranging
                                from small airborne particles that remain
                                suspended in the air for long periods, to larger
                                droplets that may remain airborne or fall to the
                                ground. This continuum between droplets and
                                aerosols has redefined the traditional
                                understanding of how respiratory viruses
                                transmit. The largest droplets of respiratory
                                fluid do not travel far, and can be inhaled, or
                                land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or
                                mouth to cause new infection. The fine aerosol
                                particles are in highest concentration when
                                people are in close proximity, leading to the
                                virus transmitting easier when people are
                                physically close. However, airborne transmission
                                does occur at longer distances, mainly in
                                locations that are poorly ventilated (such as
                                restaurants, choirs, gyms, nightclubs, offices,
                                and religious venues). In those conditions small
                                particles can remain suspended in the air for
                                minutes to hours. The number of people generally
                                infected by one infected person varies; with
                                only 10 to 20% of people responsible for the
                                diseases spread. However, in September 2020 it
                                was estimated that one infected person will, as
                                a crude average, infect between two and three
                                other people. This is more infectious than
                                influenza, but less so than measles. It often
                                spreads in clusters, where infections can be
                                traced back to an index case or geographical
                                location. There is a major role of
                                "super-spreading events", where many people are
                                infected by one person. It is possible that a
                                person might get COVID-19 indirectly by touching
                                a contaminated surface or object before touching
                                their own mouth, nose, or eyes, though strong
                                evidence suggests this does not contribute
                                substantially to new infections. Although it is
                                considered possible, there is no direct evidence
                                of the virus being transmitted by skin to skin
                                contact. The virus is not known to spread
                                through feces, urine, breast milk, food,
                                wastewater, drinking water, or via animal
                                disease vectors (although some animals can
                                contract the virus from humans). It very rarely
                                transmits from mother to baby during pregnancy.

                                SARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of
                                viruses known as coronaviruses. It is a
                                positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA)
                                virus, with a single linear RNA segment.
                                Coronaviruses infect humans, other mammals, and
                                avian species, including livestock and companion
                                animals. Human coronaviruses are capable of
                                causing illnesses ranging from the common cold
                                to more severe diseases such as Middle East
                                respiratory syndrome (MERS, fatality rate ~34%).
                                SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to
                                infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1,
                                MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV. Viral
                                genetic sequence data can provide critical
                                information about whether viruses separated by
                                time and space are likely to be
                                epidemiologically linked. With a sufficient
                                number of sequenced genomes, it is possible to
                                reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of the mutation
                                history of a family of viruses. By 12 January
                                2020, five genomes of SARS‑CoV‑2 had been
                                isolated from Wuhan and reported by the Chinese
                                Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC)
                                and other institutions; the number of genomes
                                increased to 42 by 30 January 2020. A
                                phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed
                                they were "highly related with at most seven
                                mutations relative to a common ancestor",
                                implying that the first human infection occurred
                                in November or December 2019.As of 7 May 2020,
                                4,690 SARS‑CoV‑2 genomes sampled on six
                                continents were publicly available

                                Preventive measures to reduce the chances of
                                infection include getting vaccinated, staying at
                                home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded
                                places, keeping distance from others,
                                ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential
                                exposure durations, washing hands with soap and
                                water often and for at least twenty seconds,
                                practising good respiratory hygiene, and
                                avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with
                                unwashed hands. Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or
                                who believe they may be infected are advised by
                                the CDC to stay home except to get medical care,
                                call ahead before visiting a healthcare
                                provider, wear a face mask before entering the
                                healthcare provider's office and when in any
                                room or vehicle with another person, cover
                                coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash
                                hands with soap and water and avoid sharing
